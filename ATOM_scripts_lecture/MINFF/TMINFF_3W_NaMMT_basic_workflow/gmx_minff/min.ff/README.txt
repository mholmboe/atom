This folder contains forcefield parameters for general (G)MINFF, as well as tailored (T)MINFF parameters for specific mineral (see list below).

**Lennard-Jones parameters for the general MINFF**

Lennard-Jones parameters for all metal sites optimized for over 30 mineral synchronously, 
using the Lennard-Jones parameters for the oxygen atomtypes taken from OPC3 water model fixed.  

* Filename ffnonbonded_gminff.itp:
	- General MINFF for k=0, 250, 500, 1500 kJ/mol/rad2
	- CLAYFF
	- Several ion-pair potentials and water models

	The mineral set and the angle force constant are selected with two separate
	-D flags in the .mdp file:

	    define = -DGMINFF -DMINFF_k500 -DOPC3 -DOPC3_HFE_LM

	where MINFF_k0, MINFF_k250, MINFF_k500 or MINFF_k1500 picks the O-M-O angle
	force constant in kJ/mol/rad2. The older combined form (-DGMINFF_k500) still
	works and is equivalent, so existing .mdp files need no change.

* Filename ffbonded_gminff.itp
	- bonded parameters for the general MINFF. Identical in content to
	  ffbonded.itp; kept under its own name so that each parameter set has a
	  matching forcefield/ffnonbonded/ffbonded trio.

* Filename forcefield_gminff.itp
	- include this to use the general parameters; it pulls in
	  ffnonbonded_gminff.itp and ffbonded_gminff.itp. forcefield.itp is
	  equivalent and includes ffnonbonded.itp and ffbonded.itp instead.


**Lennard-Jones parameters for the tailored MINFF**

Note that the Lennard-Jones parameters inn step 1 for each mineral were first optimized for only the metal sites only.
In a second step the oxygen Lennard-Jones parameters were optimized, keeping the metal parameters from step 1 fixed. 
These new oxygen parameters optimized in step 2 are commented by a ; and not necessarily better than the parameters optmized in step 1.

* Filename ffnonbonded_tminff.itp
	- tailored MINFF for all four angle force constants, sorted by mineral
	- CLAYFF
	- Several ion-pair potentials and water models

	This one file replaces the former ffnonbonded_tminff_k0|k250|k500|k1500.itp
	and ffnonbonded_tminff_all_k_sorted_by_mineral.itp, which have been removed.

	The mineral and the angle force constant are now selected independently,
	with two separate -D flags in the .mdp file. Both are required:

	    define = -DMontmorillonite -DMINFF_k500 -DOPC3 -DOPC3_HFE_LM

	where MINFF_k0, MINFF_k250, MINFF_k500 or MINFF_k1500 picks the O-M-O angle
	force constant in kJ/mol/rad2. The older combined form (-DMontmorillonite_k500)
	is no longer used for the tailored sets. For the general sets the old form
	(-DGMINFF_k500) still works, and is equivalent to -DGMINFF -DMINFF_k500.

* Filename ffbonded_tminff.itp
	- bonded parameters for the tailored MINFF, guarded by mineral name alone
	  since they do not depend on the angle force constant: the O-M-O stiffness
	  is applied through KANGLE in each mineral .itp file, not here.
	- Only the terms whose atomtypes the chosen mineral actually declares are
	  emitted, so grompp never sees a bondtype referring to an undeclared type.
	  Minerals without hydroxyl groups contribute no bonded terms.

* Filename forcefield_tminff.itp
	- include this instead of forcefield.itp to use the tailored parameters;
	  it pulls in ffnonbonded_tminff.itp and ffbonded_tminff.itp.
